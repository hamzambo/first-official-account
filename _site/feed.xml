Starting medical school just fresh out of high school, while still
in your teens, needs a load of courage and a leap of faith. And for me, it was a blind leap of faith. At that
point in my life, I had not yet figured out what I wanted to do, unlike some of my friends. I didn’t have a
clear idea of the career that would suit me best. Looking back, the societal expectation to make such a
life-altering decision at such a young age seems like an utterly misguided idea at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I had wanted to be different things when I grew up at different points in my life. My first dream
job was becoming a police officer. The reason was simple: policemen at my village commanded a lot of
respect(or fear, I couldn’t tell the difference) and walked around with guns, which, as a five-year-old, I
found to be really cool. The next thing I had dreamt of becoming when I grew up was a bus driver
because bus drivers travelled constantly for a living, and I loved(and still do love) travelling. Next, I had
dreamt of becoming an accountant. This one was because a very charismatic accountant came to our
school during careers day and I found his job to be particularly interesting. That was back in Form One.
And it was the last time I had thought seriously about what career I would like to pursue.
After getting my KCSE results, I was spoilt for choice about what undergraduate program I could apply
for. So, naturally, I just applied for the course that had the highest cut-off points. That course was
MBChB- Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. That’s how I landed in Chiromo Campus in the
middle of September 2015, not quite sure of what I was doing but ready for a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many words I could use to describe my experience during the first year of medical school.
Exciting. Confusing. Exhausting. Intense. But there was a common feature that this myriad of
experiences had: they all smelt of formalin. First-year medical students usually dissect cadavers during
their anatomy classes. The cadavers are preserved by a chemical called formalin which has a strong acrid
smell. Because we would spend long hours in the anatomy laboratory dissecting the cadavers, our
clothes, our hair and even our skin would smell of formalin after a long day there. Sometimes I felt that
the formalin had infiltrated my brain tissue and shut down my short-term memory. That’s because I
would have a hard time recalling an anatomical fact that had been stated by one of my tablemates just a
few minutes before. I would have blamed my poor memory squarely on the formalin had I not also been
suffering from chronic lack of enough sleep, a more plausible culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember going for supper at the university mess after the dissections and not eating much because I
could still smell formalin in the Ugali even after thoroughly washing my hands. Not that the food was
appealing to eat in the first place. Sometimes I would have a headache from the smell of formalin that
would not subside for days. At the university hostels, I shared a room with three other medical students.
So, for a few minutes after we all arrived from the dissections, the room would smell of formalin, exactly
like the anatomy laboratory. But in this case, the formalin was wasted on living beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the academic rigours of medical school, the transition from the highly structured life of my
high school to the relatively freeform days of university life was hard to navigate. In high school, days
moved slowly but they felt like they had a definite end. Days in the university moved at an astonishing
speed, all mashed up together. At the university, you could decide to do absolutely nothing but listen to
Avicii’s Levels on repeat all day and no one was there to police you. No housemaster to kick you out of
the dormitory. No hawk-eyed teacher-on-duty to chase you to class. No mum to cajole you to study. At
the end of the day, you were the one and only judge of how good you spent your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends. Friends are the family we choose. Friends are the family we choose to share the best moments
of our lives with. Making new friends is one of life’s small pleasures. But in medical school, making
friends was a survival strategy. Friends simply made life tolerable in one of the most intellectually
draining years of training in medical school. Friends formed an informal support group. Some people
retained their high school classmates as their friends in medical school. Others tried their luck with new
friends they met at the lecture hall. Some people had no trouble forming a large group of friends over a
matter of weeks. Others were either unsuccessful at making new friends or simply did not care. I
became instant friends with my three roommates, probably because they were the people I spent the
most time with outside of class. We would go for supper together after a long day of school and talk
about our hopes and fears. And maybe finally agree on who would be exiled the coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost seven years down the line, my experiences as a first-year seem like a drop in the ocean of
experiences I’ve had ever since. Those experiences are small pixels in the beautiful mosaic that my time
in medical school has been. A mosaic that has been equally decorated by all the highs and lows. There
were many things I could have done better but I believe I did the best I could with the knowledge I had
at that time. If I had one piece of advice that I could give to my younger self it would be to just take my
time to learn and grow; it would be okay in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>hamza</name></author><summary type="html">Starting anything takes a bit of courage.

Well, the pandemic proved me wrong. Maybe it was
because of the dramatic turn of events after the lockdown measures were implemented. I went
from seeing my friends everyday in school to not being able to meet anyone outside my
immediate family in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I missed the hallway jokes, the cheerful lunches,
the board games and the daily height-adjusted hugs. I missed these little things that we did with
my friends. But more importantly, I missed my friends. A lot. This got me thinking about the
place of friendships in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this common joke that Jesus’ greatest miracle was having twelve close friends in his
thirties. There is some truth to it. As we grow older it becomes increasingly hard to make new
friends. Worse still, it also gets surprisingly easy to lose old ones. Everyone becomes so
entangled in making strides in their career and their romantic lives that cultivating friendships
takes a back seat. Friendships become a social blanket that only come in handy when one is
facing cold trouble in other aspects of their lives. Your friends become backup plans, not
intentional alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that should not be the case. We meet new people everyday in our lives. We then carefully
choose to form friendships with some and leave others as mere acquaintances. The criteria we
use to pick our friends is unique to everyone. Some prefer people with the same interests and
outlook in life. Others become friends because they live close to one another. Yet others just
want to be friends with people who look like them( a good number of my friends are
suspiciously the same height as I am). But all in all, we make a conscious decision when making
friends. We should also make a conscious decision to maintain those friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you maintain friendships? Again all friendships are unique and what makes them last
are peculiar to each one. But there certain things that cut across the board. Making the effort to
regularly communicate with your friends is particularly vital. Texting. Calling. Meeting up at the
local coffee shop or via Zoom. I know our lives are becoming busier as we navigate the murky
waters of young adulthood. But time is always in your control. You can prioritize what you think
adds value to your life. So, prioritize spending time connecting with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friendships are to be nurtured. They are not accidents. They don’t just happen. They are actively
maintained. Curated. Sustained. Like all things in life sometimes friendships fail despite all our
efforts to salvage it. But that’s okay. Because we live to ‘friend’ another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>hamza</name></author><summary type="html">I used to think that I am an introvert.
