      <p>Starting anything takes a bit of courage. Starting medical school just fresh out of high school, while still
in your teens, needs a load of courage and a leap of faith. And for me, it was a blind leap of faith. At that
point in my life, I had not yet figured out what I wanted to do, unlike some of my friends. I didnâ€™t have a
clear idea of the career that would suit me best. Looking back, the societal expectation to make such a
life-altering decision at such a young age seems like an utterly misguided idea at best.</p>

      <p>I used to think that I am an introvert. Well, the pandemic proved me wrong. Maybe it was
because of the dramatic turn of events after the lockdown measures were implemented. I went
from seeing my friends everyday in school to not being able to meet anyone outside my
immediate family in a matter of days.</p>
